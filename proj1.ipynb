    "\n",
    "Create a new dataframe of counts of the null and proportion of null values, storing the result in `fraction_missing_df`. It should have an index called `postal_code_5` and should also have 3 columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `count null`: The number of missing values for the zip code.\n",
    "2. `count non null`: The number of present values for the zip code.\n",
    "3. `fraction null`: The fraction of values that are null for the zip code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your data frame should be sorted by the fraction null in descending order. The first two rows of your answer should include postal code 94107 and 94124.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended approach: Build three series with the appropriate names and data and then combine them into a dataframe. This will require some new syntax you may not have seen.\n",

It also appears that there are higher frequencies of even-numbered scores just compared to their odd-numbered neighbors. This implies that scores are given somewhat leniently and that the graders tended towards giving even-numbered scores."

It should be exactly the same as `ins`, except that it should have the name and address of every business, as determined by the `bus` dataframe. If a `business_id` in `ins` does not exist in `bus`, the name and address should be given as NaN.\n",

    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",

    "We would expect the scatter plot to have values to the top left of the red line. The red line is for when there is no improvement between the first and second score (difference = 0). When the values are to the left of the line, that means that the second score is higher than the first score. In my scatterplot, I see that the bulk of the values are to the left of the line, meaning that most businesses experienced a net increase in their score from the first to the second evaluation. \n",

    "We would expect the bulk of the histogram data to be right of 0, aka positive, meaning that there is a positive increase between the first and second inspection scores. For my histogram, I saw an overall balanced graph, where the bulk of the score differences were around 0. There seems to be roughly the same number of data points on the left and right of the center histogram bar. This means that roughly an equal number of restaurants did worse on the second review as those who did better, which is to expected. "
